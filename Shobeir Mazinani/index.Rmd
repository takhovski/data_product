## Motor Trend Car Road Tests

### Description

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

## Summary of Regression Model
```{r}
data("mtcars")
summary(lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars))$coefficients

## Regression Model Continue
Based on the coefficients, it seems that with moving from automatic to manual 2.5 units increase in the `mpg` accounting for all the other parameters. Now, we build 5 models with `am`, `wt` (weight), `qsec` (1/4 mile time), and `cyl` (number of cylinders).

## Shiny App

The Shiny App uses three of the most important factors to plot their effects on `mpg` with respect to the `automatic` versus `manual` transmission.
